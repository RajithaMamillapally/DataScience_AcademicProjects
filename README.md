# DataScience_AcademicProjects
This Repository consists of Projects done by me for Academic purposes.Projects are presented in the form of Google colab notebooks.
## Instructions for running Python Notebooks Locally
1.Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2.Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
## Contents
### Machine Learning:
#### Supervised Learning:
[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/RajithaMamillapally/DataScience_AcademicProjects/tree/main/Capsone_project):A predictive model to identify and reduce customer churn, contributing to improved customer retention strategies.
[Election Outcomes and Seat Distribution Analysis]():Tested out different Supervised learning models to build a model to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.
[Contraceptive Usage prediction]():Developed a predictive model that determines whether married women in Indonesia, who are not pregnant or uncertain about their pregnancy status, use a contraceptive method of choice. The model is based on demographic and socio-economic characteristics collected from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey.
[System Activity Modeling for 'usr' Mode Prediction]():A linear regression model is built, which predicts the 'usr' (portion of time in user mode) based on a list of system attributes collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712. The goal is to understand how each attribute affects the system's behavior in 'usr' mode.
#### Unsupervised Learning:
[Clustering Digital Ads](): Segmented types of ads based on key features using K means clustering, Hierarchical clustering procedures and provided insights for strategic decision-making in Marketing Analytics.<br>
[Unravelling patterns in Indian female Headed household census data]():Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Primary Census Abstract data for female-headed households (excluding institutional households) from the 2011 Census in India. Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from the Scikit-Learn library to identify and explore the optimum principal components that explain the most variance in the dataset.<br>
### Time Series forecasting:
-[Analysis and Forecasting of Wine Sales]():Analyzed and forecasted wine sales for two types of wines (Sparkling and Rose) in the 20th century using time series data. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), decomposition, model building, stationarity checks, and an automated ARIMA/SARIMA model. The ultimate goal  of this project is to provide actionable insights for ABC Estate Wines to optimize sales strategies.<br>
### SQL project:
-[Data-Driven Decision-Making for Reliant Retail Limited]:Analyzed the "orders" database of Reliant Retail Limited and provided insights through SQL queries that will guide data-driven decisions for enhancing overall growth and efficiency of the online retail store.
